---

### üìå Requirements

#### üéØ ---- Main ----
1.) Seed Data
Insert the following rows into the Role table:
```ts
admin with id = 1

tutor with id = 2

student with id = 3
```

2.) Add a Lesson model
- Define a new Lesson model with the following:

  - title (String)

  - description (String)

  - A relation to the User who created the lesson ‚Äî Only users with the admin role (id: 1) should be allowed to create lessons ‚Äî assume this is enforced at the application level.
  
  - A many-to-many relation with Students to allow enrollments.

  - A many-to-many relation with Tutors to allow assigning tutors to lessons.

3.) Update existing models as needed
- Make any required changes to the existing models to support these relationships.

4.) CRUD Operations (Functionalities)
  - Users
    - Create Admin, Tutor, and Student users (with appropriate role IDs)

  - Lessons:
    - ADMIN (‚ö†Ô∏è *Accessible by Admins only*)
      - **Create**, **Update**, or **Delete** Lessons (‚ö†Ô∏è Prevent creation of duplicate lessons ‚Äî e.g., by title).
        
      - **Assign** or **Remove** Tutors from Lessons
        
    - Students (‚ö†Ô∏è *Accessible by Students only*)
      - Enroll into a Lesson (‚ö†Ô∏è A student cannot enroll in the same lesson more than once)

      - Opt out of a Lesson

5.) Schema Expectations

  - Use Prisma schema syntax

  - Use @relation, onDelete, and foreign keys properly

  - Explicit join models allowed and encouraged when needed

---

#### üéÅ ---- Bonus / Extras ----

1.) Lesson Status Enum
- Add a status field to Lesson with enum values:

  - DRAFT, PUBLISHED, ARCHIVED

- Enforce that only lessons with status PUBLISHED can be enrolled into.


2.) Prevent Over-Assignment
- Limit the number of tutors that can be assigned to a single lesson (e.g., max 3).

-  Enforce this in your API logic.

3.) Logging / Auditing
- Create a LessonLog model to store changes to lessons:
  - lessonId, action, performedByUserId, timestamp. (Admins only)
    - e.g. Updated the title / description of a lesson. 

4.) Advanced Querying
- Add an endpoint:
  - "Get all lessons a student is enrolled in, including assigned tutors and lesson status."

5.) Soft Deletes
  - Implement soft deletes for Lesson:
    - Add an isActive: Boolean field
    - Add a deletedAt: DateTime? field (optional timestamp for soft deletion)

  - Filter out soft-deleted lessons from queries.
    - e.g. Allow querying of both active and deleted lessons based on flags.

  - Code Quality: Code is clean, readable, and logically organized, following good backend architecture practices.

  - Error Handling: Errors are handled gracefully, with clear and informative responses.

  - Bonus Completion: Optional stretch goals are attempted or completed, showing deeper understanding and initiative.
